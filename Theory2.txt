Automatic gain control 
with diodes

The conventional oscillator circuit is designed so that it will start oscillating ("start up") and that its amplitude will be controlled.
The oscillator at the right uses diodes to add a controlled compression to the amplifier output. It can produce total harmonic distortion in the range of 1-5%, depending on how carefully it is trimmed.
Automatic gain control - depending on the output voltage magnitude.
Using diodes for AGC:
If the voltage drop VD
increases,
the equivalent static resistance rD
decreases
